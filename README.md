# XSS Vulnerability Analyzer
## Overview
This project was for a course teaching application software security. The project topic was *Cross-site scripting (XSS)*, a client-side variant of the injection attack, which attempts to trick a website into placing malicious code onto a visitor's browser. To demonstrate an understanding of XSS, contributors developed a web application that can analyze HTML code, detect XSS vulnerabilities, and report the problems.

Guidelines and examples provided by [OWASP](https://owasp.org/search/?searchString=xss) were used to aid the creation of the analyzer.

## Requirements
- Node.js, to install packages required by the Web App
- Python3, to install packages for the backend analyzer

   * Open a terminal.
   * CD into the xvs_frontend/ directory.
   * Enter the command *npm install*
2. To install the required back-end packages:   
   * Open a terminal.
